Preparation
To use the API, please log in to the web platform, create and configure API keys with proper permissions, then proceed with development and trading as detailed in this documentation.

Click here to create an API Key.

Each user can create up to 10 API Key groups. Each key can be configured for "Read" and/or "Trade" permissions.

Permission details:

Read permission: for data queries such as market data.
Trade permission: enables order placement, cancellation, and related actions.
After creating an API Key, securely store the following:

APIKey — The unique identifier for API authentication which is algorithmically generated.
SecretKey — The system-generated private key for signature encryption.
Passphrase —A user-defined access phrase. Note: If lost, the Passphrase cannot be recovered. You must create a new API key.
tip
You can bind IP addresses to API keys when creating API keys. Unrestricted API keys (with no IP address binding) pose security risks.

warning
Risk warning: These three keys directly impact account security. Never share your Passphrase. Losing any of these keys may result in asset loss. Delete compromised API keys immediately.
API Types
This section categorizes APIs into two types:

Public APIs
Private APIs
Public APIs

Public APIs allow users to retrieve configuration and market data.These requests do not require authentication.

Private APIs

Private APIs enable order management and account management.Each private request must be authenticated using a standardized signature method.

Private APIs require validation with your API key.

Access Restrictions
This section outlines access restrictions:

Rest API: Returns the "429 Too Many Requests" status if the frequency limit is exceeded.
Rest API

Requests with valid API keys are rate-limited by the API key. Requests without API keys are rate-limited by the public IP address.

Rate limiting rules: The default limit is 10 requests/second unless specified otherwise in individual endpoint documentation.

Special note for batch orders: Placing a batch order comprised of 4 trading pairs with 10 orders each counts as 1 request.
